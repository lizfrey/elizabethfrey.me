# Personal Website

## Background
This project is my response to the Basic Webpage Challenge. While I had some experience with React through the DALI Lab Mini Web Development Course, my participation in the course was cut a little short at the end when I had some personal problems that forced me to leave campus. This project, in essence, was my attempt to relearn and experiment with some of the skills I learned in that course while also trying out new things. In particular, I experienced using components from React-Bootstrap and scss files, which I had never used before. I also played around with basic animations and tried to incorporate some cool bootstrap ideas. 

## Usage

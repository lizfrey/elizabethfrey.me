# Personal Website

## Background
This is my personal website! I used a starterpack similar to the one used in Dartmouth's [CS 52](https://brunchlabs.notion.site/SA2-Frontend-Starterpack-with-Vite-Short-Assignment-9dd840d042624cc2a9f6527dfaeb25dd)

## Usage
The deployed version of the website can be found at [elizabethfrey.me](https://www.elizabethfrey.me). It is made using GitHub Pages. If it is currently down, that's probably because I forgot to pay for the domain. Sorry about that.
